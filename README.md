# corset_pipeline
Pipeline used to produce a de novo transcriptome from different RNA-seq libraries

*** VERY IMPORTANT ***
Raw read files have to conform to a very specific name format, but you can change
the code so that it fits with whatever name your read files have.

*** USAGE ***
Use the scripts contained in the "01_scripts" directory. They are numbered, so start from 01.trimming.sh
and so on, until you've reached the end of the pipeline.

Input/Output files will be automatically taken from/added to the appropriate directory.
